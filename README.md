# Prepaid cards

A simple console application for tracking gift cards. Users can add new gift cards by entering details such as the card number, the amount in euros, the buyer, and the recipient. The main menu displays a list of all stored gift cards, allowing users to edit the balance or remove cards as needed. All card details are saved and retrieved from a text file, ensuring data persistence between sessions.
